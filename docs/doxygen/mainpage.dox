/*! \mainpage Introduction

LMS API is a set of C functions that are exported by LimeSuite library. Its main purpose is to  provide a relatively simple interface for controlling LimeSDR boards. LMS API provides both high-level and low-level methods for configuring devices. \ref FN_HIGH_LVL allow to quickly configure device by accessing and modifying multiple internal device settings during their execution. Meanwhile, \ref FN_LOW_LVL provide an ability to individually access various internal device settings (registers, clocks, etc.).
